# Hi there, who am I?
I love flowers and of course computers. I am a tenor.

Have you ever listened to "A te, o cara"? - Please, listen.

Art and software are inseparable.

I am writing.

Like Nazim. I want! In spite of life! - "On Living" 

I hope...

Like Edgar. I don't mean it. "Nevermore."



Did I mention that engineering is an art for me?
